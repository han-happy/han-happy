<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

## Hi! My name is Hanh but I go by Happy.

I'm a third-year Cognitive Science Major @ UC Irvine!  
I had a minor interest in coding ever since highschool.  
Being able to problem-solve my way through things really makes me ... happy!  
I've only taken a few beginner classes in Python and I'm picking up Matlab in my research lab.  
Other than that, I'm following ICSSC fellowship program to learn more on my own!  
Feel free to reach out to me at hanhh2@uci.edu!
