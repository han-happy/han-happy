<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

## Hi! My name is Hanh but I go by Happy.

I'm a third-year Cognitive Science Major @ UC Irvine!  
I have a strong interest in data science from the computational modeling classes I took. Given a data set to play around with models to make sense of the neural network is fascinating.  
Feel free to reach out to me at hanhh2@uci.edu!
